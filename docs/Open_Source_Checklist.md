# The Open Source Release Checklist

## About

It is easy to forget a few important tasks when releasing and improving an Open Source Project.
This checklist is here to help your project with suggestions.

Use this checklist in a practical way - as a discussion starter for the project, as a base for future improvements.

### Documentation

- **Verify that the project fulfills the basic standard of Community Health Files (CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING etc).  
    See [README.md - Template Files Explanation](README.md#contents) for a basic list and further information**
- **Add any relevant, usage documentation, Software Architecture Descriptions regarding the project.**

### Workflows

- **Discuss your GitHub-workflow - a brief summary and suggestion can be found in [CONTRIBUTING - Pull Request Lifecycle](CONTRIBUTING.adoc)**

### Project Quality

- **Verify there has been a code review of the project**
- **Discuss and implement the projects testing goals and ambitions**

### Release and versioning

- **Use semantic versioning and release tags**

### Naming and trademarks check

- **Ensure that the project name does not conflict with an existing project or infringe on trademarks.**

  - Do a general sanity search engine check of the proposed project name.
  - Do a trademark search at [PRV](https://www.prv.se/sv/immaterialrattsexpert/varumarke/databaser/)

    > It might be ok to use a name that is reminiscent of an existing trademark, if the existing trademark is used for other services/areas and is not recognized as a known trademark.

### Legal and Licensing

- **Ensure that the license of the project is not in conflict with third party licenses**
- **Declare the licenses for _other resources than code_ (images, text etc). [REUSE](https://reuse.software) will help you describe these.**

### Security

- **TODO: General guidance will be added in the future**
- **For details regarding GitHub- or Contributor- specific security, see (Yet-to-be-written: How we work on GitHub** and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.adoc)**

### People & maintenance

- **Ensure there is a maintenance and archival (if non maintained) plan**
- **Ensure that any maintaining team has gotten some education or experience regarding working Open Source**
- **Ensure that any maintaining team has a plan for handling community issues (responding to issues, reviewing and merging pull requests)**
- **Is there a need for a release plan? - if so, ensure that is clear how it should be announced and promoted**

### Open Source Excellence

There a quite a few extra steps you might want to consider for keeping your Open Source Projects clean, clear, re-usable, accessible and up-to-date.

- Consider [following the REUSE licensing standard](https://reuse.software/)
- Prefer declaring licenses with the [SPDX-standard](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files/)
- Consider [following the Foundation for Public Code recommendations](https://standard.publiccode.net/)
